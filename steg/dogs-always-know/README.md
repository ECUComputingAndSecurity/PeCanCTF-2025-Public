This is a two-stage challenge. In the first stage, students must locate a Base64-encoded string hidden at the end of the sigrun.jpg image file. Once decoded—using a tool like CyberChef—this string reveals the passphrase needed for the second stage. In stage two, students use the passphrase to extract a hidden file named scent.txt from the image using steganography tools such as StegSeek. The scent.txt file contains the flag required to complete the challenge.
