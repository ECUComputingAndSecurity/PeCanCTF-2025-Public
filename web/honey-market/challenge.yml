  Just yesterday, an FBI agent uncovered a newly launched darknet forum linked to a notorious cybercrime group,
  infamous for hacking and selling classified data from critical organizations. The U.S. government and ACSC have
  brought you in to uncover who's behind it, and thanks to a slip-up by the site's admin, we managed to get a peek
  at their source code. But beware: these suckers know they're being hunted, so heads up for traps!

  Now, time is ticking! Find the flaw. Bring them down.
