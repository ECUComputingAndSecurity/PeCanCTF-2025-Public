# Future Feature

> This note is for Steve when he comes back from his holiday with his GF.

Ok, Steve...

YYOOO !!! HURRY UP !!!

...please

Because the deadline for the final Sprint is next week, we need to finish this product fast, just one way or another, and try to finish coding it as quickly as possible. The thing to focus on right now is the feature, not security or anything else... Just make it work!

Anyway, I have left a source code of the `/post.php` page, that I was halfway finished in this directory as well, please finish it as soon as possible,

## P.S:

```
Please delete this directory or at least forbid anyone who is not from the local whitelisted IP range from seeing it because I don't know, it can be a security risk, maybe?
```
