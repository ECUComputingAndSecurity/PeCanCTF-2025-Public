# About

This document outlines the upcoming plans for future CTF tournaments, including whether to host them on-site or online, and whether there should be prizes. So far, nothing has been done, so let's review what we have for the current tournament.

## Plan:

1. Organize
2. Make a new website since this one isn't very secure maybe and we as a CTF organization can't afford to be insecure.
3. Need a sponsor, maybe I will note my banking details here, nothing wrong with that.

# Fun Fact

This challenge was based on a real pentest that i used to do, and sometime the smallest mistakes can lead to some consequences.

> In real life, the API key will belong to services like AWS, Google Cloud, or other sensitive platforms. I tried to similarize this challenge to AWS services like S3-bucket, GuardDuty, and SecretManager.

Here is one real-life incident where this kind of vuln actually happened: https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/au/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/tesla-and-jenkins-servers-fall-victim-to-cryptominers
