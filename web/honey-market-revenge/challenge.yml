  Uh oh! The darknet market is up and running again, despite our previous efforts to shut it down.
  This time, the new admin seems to have learned from their past mistakes, because no source code was leaked.
  This likely means new protections are in place. The good news? No traps this time so we better move fast 
  before they tighten the net.

  Notice: The challenge is based on the prior "Honey Market" challenge, it's recommended to finish it first
  before trying out this one to fully understand the goal.
