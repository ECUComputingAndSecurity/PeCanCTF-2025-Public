Augustus was the son and heir of Julius Caesar, hinting at the history of the cipher.

During his reign, Augustus modified the Caesar cipher according to Wikipedia: "with a right shift of one, and it did not wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet (B for A, C for B, and the rest of the letters on the same principle, using AA for Z)"

When applying this principle to the cipher, Fwfo_Djqifsaa_Fwpmwf becomes Even_Cipherz_Evolve.
