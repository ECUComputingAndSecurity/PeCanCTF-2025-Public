  Ah, breakfast. The moment the sun peeks over the horizon,
  there's nothing quite like the smell of something sizzling
  on the stove. I never skip it, not because I'm a morning
  person, but because breakfast is where I find my true
  calling. Some people go for cereal, others toast, but me?
  I like to keep things crispy.

  There's an art to my morning routine. Two eggs, slightly
  runny. A cup of coffee, black. And the crown jewel: that
  smoky, salty perfection that never fails to put a smile on
  my face. My absolute favourite. It's a little indulgent,
  sure, but worth every bite.

  They say breakfast is the most important meal of the dayâ€¦
  maybe that's why I hid the message there. You just have to
  know where to look underneath the layers.
