  I have created a comically simple? hash function. Find a clash and I'll give you the library to drive to. That is, if you can read what i have. My bad I drank 32 ml of Base model Dasani before making this.

  pycryptodome may be needed, so install this before hand.

  Remember to encapsulate the flag in `pecan{flag}`.
