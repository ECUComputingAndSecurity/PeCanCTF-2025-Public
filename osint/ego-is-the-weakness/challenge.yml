  A ransomware operation was spotted recently, which resulted in millions of dollars lost in seconds.
  After some collaborative investigation with the government, we traced its activities back to an Instagram account, which is believed to belong to the culprit.
  Can you help us identify the address of a place that this cybercriminal often visits?
  Our intel indicates that there is a high chance this person is still young, so they haven't graduated yet.
