The day I was pulled from my once warm, cozy stalk, encapsulated by my lovely husk.  This was the day I was brutally ambushed, forced to find a new home in this cold, barren place. These selfish animals kept trying to point at me, laugh, or even try and take a bite of me. It was the most traumatizing experience of my life. After days of travel, I made it to the big city, ready to find a new life.
