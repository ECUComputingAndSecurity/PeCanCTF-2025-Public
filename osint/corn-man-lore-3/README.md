After opening up the Instagram page from the previous challenge (part 3/cornman25944), you are given 17 posts.  If you get the suburb of each the images, you get this (in the order of when the corn man travelled):

Perth, Hillary's, Ellenbrook, Ascot, Joondalup, Glendalough, Wanneroo, Ashdale, Yanchep, Caversham, Ashby, Kingsway, Woodvale, Belmont, Banksia Grove, Butler, Bullsbrook, which would give you: PHEAJGWAYCAKWBBBB

However, each description includes a number, or a position.  You can use this position to figure out which letter in the word will be used to the flag, so you get:
Perth: First (P)
Hillarys: 1 (H)
Ellenbrook: 8 (O)
Ascot: Last (T)
Joondalup: 2 (O)
Glendalough: First (G)
Wanneroo: 6 (R)

Kingsway: 4 (G)
Woodvale: 8 (E)
Belmont: 6 (N)
Banksia Grove: 6 (I)
Butler: 2 (U)
Bullsbrook: 5 (S)

Which will give you: PHOTOGRAPHYGENIUS, which will split into PHOTOGRAPHY_GENIUS
