  Every day, Jamie walks the tree-lined streets of Melbourne's southern suburbs to reach their secondary school â€” a place where the morning roll call is often interrupted by the distant thunder of aircraft overhead.

  One afternoon, while mapping out local landmarks for a class project, Jamie discovered something curious: their school might just be the closest secondary school to a major airport. Even more peculiar, it's also just a stone's throw from sprawling golf greens, where quiet swings contrast the rush of jet engines.

  Can you uncover the school that Jamie calls home? Flag format: `pecan{my_high_school}`
