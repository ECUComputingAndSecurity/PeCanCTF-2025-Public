  A simple web app lets you upload image files to view their EXIF metadata. But something feels off... are your images being analyzed a little too deeply?
  Can you trick the server into running a command of your own — and reveal the contents of a hidden flag.txt file?

  Note: Only image file uploads are allowed. You won't need brute force — just a little creativity and the right format.
