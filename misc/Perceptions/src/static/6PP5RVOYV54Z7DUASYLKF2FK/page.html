        Thought today's post would be a short one about what this server is. It's a full Linux container, but I only use it for web serving and some pretty generic Linux remote access stuff at the moment. It used to have a few ports open to run different things but now that I have Perceptions I only need one port for everything which is pretty cool. Not much else to say at the moment but I might run a game server on it which would be fun.

        If you have any suggestions for me leave a comment below! When I add that feature anyway...
