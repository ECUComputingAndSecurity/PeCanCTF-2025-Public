      <p>
        I went on a trip for a few days here once. It was nice, we celebrated one of my friends' birthdays on the last night, so pretty good time overall.
        <br><br>
        On this day I went for a walk in the morning, and I just kept walking. There's a little town with some general shops and souvenir places, I went out towards the back where there's some houses and found another path. There was some bushland that had some tracks for people to walk on so I followed them around until I got to here.
        <br><br>
        All in all had a good day. Found everyone else a bit later and played cards.
